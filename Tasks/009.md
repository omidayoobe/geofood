# Task 009: 
## Confirm Information Handled And Where It Comes From
Information flow - based on the [plan](https://github.com/wtznc/software_projects/blob/master/Plan.md) published on 17th Oct.

- Replace farmers 👨🏻‍🌾 with any other profession suitable for this plan.
- Replace bananas 🍌 with any other product suitable for this plan.


### Farmers grow bananas
When the fruits are ready for harvesting the plant is cut off and the first QR code has to be generated.
Farmers have to use our website (eg. login -> add new product) or mobile app (login -> add new product) to provide information such as: 
- **company’s name and address**, 
- **products details (type of banana)**,
- **date when the fruits were harvested**. 

We create for them that QR code as a *.pdf file.
They print out the QR code and put it on the boxes where bananas are stored.


### Farmers sell bananas to Tesco, Sainsburys, Whatever etc.
They scan the QR code from the box they want to sell, the previous data is loaded from our database and now they are able to add more information about: 
- **amount of bananas sold**,
- **price(?)**,
- **name and address of a company which bought it**.


`while(product.hasBeenDeliveredToTheCOmpanyWhichBoughtIt == false):`
    Bananas are collected by a shipper who does the same thing, scans QR and add information about the company which transports the product from **A** to **B**, and details of place **A** and place **B**.
