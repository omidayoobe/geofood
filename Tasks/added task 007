Task 007

**Introducing potential stakeholders:**

Any person that goes to supermarkets, markets and restaurants will be interacting directly with end product.

The software project group N will manage the front end and backend of the application.

Our potential clients for the front input of the information will be farms slaughterhouses. Their input will be the information of how, where, the fruits, vegetables and meat were produced and when those would have been packaged and sent.

Middle input are warehouses and places where the different products will be dispatched.

End input will be the supermarkets, markets and restaurants.

After this process any buyer will be able to scan the QR code and know exactly where the food has been, where it comes the date and visual trajectory.

In order to keep the trust of their costumers and full transparency any place that sells food would acquire this application.
