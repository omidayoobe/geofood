 Hi,

We are a group of students in our 2nd year from Goldsmiths University of London studying Computer Science, we are developing a project that could make life better as we know it. We are just looking for some feedback to see what you think and if our project sounds interesting to your business.

How can we make life better you might ask? It's a big question and a bold statement we know, but one activity that is direct proportional for better living is nutrition. The healthier you are the happier you are it's simple as that!

Nowadays, we're bombarded with thousands of products. You have an incredible amount to choose from. For example bananas, when you walk into a store there is a large variety of bananas to choose from. They are from different countries, they have been grown using different various methods, the carbon footprint is different, is it fair trade or not? And so on. The consumer has no information about these products and cannot make a moral healthy decision. Another example is all these products that are advertised that are organic, fair trade, quality this and quality that, you know the story. But how exactly do we know that what they are advertising is true, who can confirm it? The answer is no one.

We are developing an app that will keep track of all of these questions that the consumer has and that will verify if a product is as organic and healthy as advertised. The consumer will have access to all of these information just by using an app on their phone and scanning the products QR code. The product will have all the information of how, who, where has it been grown, carbon footprint, how long did it take to get in front of the customer, what routes, stops did it take and our special algorithm will calculate an overall satisfaction of the said product taking all the variables mentioned.

We are aiming to ease the decision making of buyers, validating the truthfulness of advertised products, helping out small and local farms growing organic food. We think by offering the people the means they will make better decisions improving their nutrition and ultimately improving life in general. There are too many false advertisements and more and more people are dying and their health is deteriorating from all these fake products full of chemicals.

Hi,

It’s a big question and a bold statement we know, but one activity that is direct proportional for better living is nutrition.
The healthier you are the happier you are it’s simple as that!

Nowadays, we’re bombarded with thousands of products. You have an incredible amount to choose from. 
For example bananas, when you walk into a store there is a large variety of bananas to choose from. 
They are from different countries, they have been grown using different various methods, the carbon footprint is different, 
is it fair trade or not? And so on. The consumer has no information about these products and cannot make a moral healthy 
decision. Another example is all these products that are advertised that are organic, fair trade, quality this and quality that,
you know the story. But how exactly do we know that what they are advertising is true, who can confirm it? 
The answer is no one. 

We are developing an app that will keep track of all of these questions that the consumer has and that will verify if a product
is as organic and healthy as advertised. The consumer will have access to all of these information just by using an app on 
their phone and scanning the products QR code. The product will have all the information of how, who, where has it been grown, 
carbon footprint, how long did it take to get in front of the customer, what routes, stops did it take and our special

and their health is deteriorating from all these fake products full of chemicals. 

I would love if you could find the time to answer these questions:

1. Do you agree with all the problems listed above?
2. Do you think transparency is important?
3. Would you think it can have an impact on the food industry?
4. Do you think it could help improve and promote a healthy lifestyle?
5. Would you be interested in an app like this?
