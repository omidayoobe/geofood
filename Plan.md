# **GeoFood**

**Basic Outline (oversimplified for outline sake)**
1. Farmer grows a bunch of bananas.
2. Farmer puts bananas in a box, prints off a unique QR code and sticks it to the box.
3. Farmer scans the box with his phone in app, adds QR to the database with his ID, geolocation and datetimestamp.
4. Hands it to shipper, they scan adding the same details as above. At each handover, stopping point and change of hands, this occurs.
5. Delivered to supermarket x where it is scanned in for the final time and placed on the shelves.
6. Customer picks it up and wants to see where the food was grown, who grew it and how it got here.
7. Customer opens our app, scans the QR code on the packaging and they are served a map with pins and details of where, when and who it was with.
8. The customer now has a choice to buy a product with a verifiable lower carbon footprint or a product that has been verified to come from a source where a fair wage has been paid.
