# The Project Concept - GeoFood

## 1. Stakeholders

The software project group N will manage the front end and backend of the application.

Any person that goes to supermarkets, markets and restaurants will be interacting directly with end product.

Our potential clients for the front input of the information will be farms slaughterhouses. Their input will be the information of how, where, the fruits, vegetables and meat were produced and when those would have been packaged and sent.

Middle input are warehouses and places where the different products will be dispatched.

End input will be the supermarkets, markets and restaurants.

After this process any buyer will be able to scan the QR code and know exactly where the food has been, where it comes the date and visual trajector, this will allow users to have a peace of mind on whether the products are satisfactory and allows them to compare amongst other competitors.


Aside from competitor organisations other key steakholders will consist of companies such as Fairtrade, by implementing our application it will allow suppliers in this case farmers to be treated honourably. As with the detailed analysis of how the products were produced it differentiates it between other suppliers, providing a more valid reason to be sold for more. This works both ways as supermarket chains are then able to identify and compare suppliers amongst one another.

World fair trade organisation being one of the biggest companies to help create a justified resolution amongst suppliers and supermarkets, would be another valued steakholder as one of the main goals for this project was to help tackle this situation in particular. By displaying information to the end user it will help spread the word.


In order to keep the trust of their customers and full transparency any place that sells food would acquire this application.

## 3. Potential User Base

**We have two potential user bases:**

- The people who will use the app to add their products to the system at any point in their journey
- The people who will use the app to track their food

<b><u>Farmers and supermarket</u></b>
<br>
The first group will be people such as farmers, transporters and supermarkets. They will be the ones using the app for scanning their goods' QR codes to tag the route they have taken to arrive at their destination. These people will likely have a range of technical understanding as we would be targeting more "traditional" farmers who might be less modernised than some. This means our app needs to have a simple user interface. However, to make sure that all our users can use the app to its full effect, it might require some training maybe in the form of videos or manuals inside the app.
Transporters and supermarkets will have a much smaller job compared to the farmers themselves as that is where most of the information about the products will have to be entered.

<br> 

<b><u>General users of the app</u></b>
<br>
As for the other group they will be the users of the main app who will be scanning their items’ QR codes to check where their food has really come from and how it actually got to them. This means our app will have a broad audience, however majority of the people will most likely to be teenagers and adults. In order for us to make the app more appealing towards the older audience we need to make the user interface as simple as possible, so its easy for all age groups to navigate around. 



## 4. Use Case Scenario

**Overview 1.0**

**Primary actors:**
Supplier
Shipping
Customer

**Preconditions:**
All have an active internet connection

**Basic flow of events:**

**1.** Supplier opens the non-consumer application and enters their details.

**2.** Supplier's details are validated.

**3.** Supplier selects the product they are about to hand to shipping.

**4.** Their details and details on the product are added to the database, timestamped, geotagged, and a QR code is generated and associated.

**5.** The supplier hands over the product to the carrier and using the same application, scans the QR code and associates their ID with the database entry.

**6.** Product arrives with the seller who scans the products location one final time.

**7.** Consumer opens the consumer specific application and has their details verified.

**8.** The QR code on the packaging of the product is scanned by the consumer.

**9.** The application displays information related to the product associated with that QR code held in the database.

**10.** This may include:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**10a.** Pictures of the supplier, how much the supplier was paid for the product, where the supplier is located, the list of carriers and locations the product has been, timestamped notable events for the product, CO2 footprint of product.

**11.** The consumer now has the information necessary to chose to purchase a product where they know who created it, where and when, who handled it, how long it took to get to them.

**Alternative flows:**

**2a.** Supplier is not validated

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2a1.** Non-consumer application displays an error message.

**5a.** If the product changes hands at any point, the process will be repeated for the new carrier.

**7a.** Consumer is not validated

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**7a1.** Consumer application displays an error message.

## 5. Information that will be handled and where it will come from

- Replace farmers 👨🏻‍🌾 with any other profession suitable for this plan.
- Replace bananas 🍌 with any other product suitable for this plan.


### Farmers grow bananas
When the fruits are ready for harvesting the plant is cut off and the first QR code has to be generated.
Farmers have to use our website (eg. login -> add new product) or mobile app (login -> add new product) to provide information such as: 
- **company’s name and address**, 
- **products details (type of banana)**,
- **date when the fruits were harvested**. 

We create for them that QR code as a *.pdf file.
They print out the QR code and put it on the boxes where bananas are stored.


### Farmers sell bananas to Tesco, Sainsburys, Whatever etc.
They scan the QR code from the box they want to sell, the previous data is loaded from our database and now they are able to add more information about: 
- **amount of bananas sold**,
- **price(?)**,
- **name and address of a company which bought it**.


`while(product.hasBeenDeliveredToTheCompanyWhichBoughtIt == false):`

   Bananas are collected by a shipper who does the same thing, scans QR and add information about the company which transports the product from **A** to **B**, and details of place **A** and place **B**.
