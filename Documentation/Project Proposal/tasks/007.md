Task 007

**Introducing potential stakeholders:**

Any person that goes to supermarkets, markets and restaurants will be interacting directly with end product.

The software project group N will manage the front end and backend of the application.

Our potential clients for the front input of the information will be farms slaughterhouses. Their input will be the information of how, where, the fruits, vegetables and meat were produced and when those would have been packaged and sent.

Middle input are warehouses and places where the different products will be dispatched.

End input will be the supermarkets, markets and restaurants.

After this process any buyer will be able to scan the QR code and know exactly where the food has been, where it comes the date and visual trajector, this will allow users to have a peace of mind on whether the products are satisfactory and allows them to compare amongst other competitors.


Aside from competitor organisations other key steakholders will consist of companies such as Fairtrade, by implementing our application it will allow suppliers in this case farmers to be treated honourably. As with the detailed analysis of how the products were produced it differentiates it between other suppliers, providing a more valid reason to be sold for more. This works both ways as supermarket chains are then able to identify and compare suppliers amongst one another.

World fair trade organisation being one of the biggest companies to help create a justified resolution amongst suppliers and supermarkets, would be another valued steakholder as one of the main goals for this project was to help tackle this situation in particular. By displaying information to the end user it will help spread the word.


In order to keep the trust of their customers and full transparency any place that sells food would acquire this application.
