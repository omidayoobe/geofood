# Task 008: #
## Potential User Base ##

**We have two potential user bases:**

1. The people who will use the app to add their products to the system at any point in their journey
2. The people who will use the app to track their food

<b><u>Farmers and supermarket</u></b>
<br>
The first group will be people such as farmers, transporters and supermarkets. They will be the ones using the app for scanning their goods' QR codes to tag the route they have taken to arrive at their destination. These people will likely have a range of technical understanding as we would be targeting more "traditional" farmers who might be less modernised than some. This means our app needs Sto have a simple user interface. However, to make sure that all our users can use the app to its full effect, it might require some training maybe in the form of videos or manuals inside the app.
Transporters and supermarkets will have a much smaller job compared to the farmers themselves as that is where most of the information about the products will have to be entered.

<br> 

<b><u>General users of the app</u></b>
<br>
As for the other group they will be the users of the main app who will be scanning their itemsâ€™ QR codes to check where their food has really come from and how it actually got to them. This means our app will have a broad audience, however majority of the people will most likely to be teenagers and adults. In order for us to make the app more appealing towards the older audience we need to make the user interface as simple as possible, so its easy for all age groups to navigate around.
