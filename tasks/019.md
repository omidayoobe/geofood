## Computer Misuse Act 1990: ##

## The Computer misuse act consists of 3 main offences:
- -- Accessing computer material without permission, eg looking at someone else's files.
- -- Accessing computer material without permission with intent to commit further criminal offences.

#### Access clearance must be set for staff, so that people with unauthorized access are unable to retrieve data and alter information or make changes towards them with criminal intent or harm.

## The Data Protection act: ##


- -- The Data Protection Act (DPA) is a law designed to protect personal data stored on computers or in an organised paper filing system. The act itself follow 8 different principles which are:
Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless:


- -- Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.
Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.


#### Data related to the project may consist of personal information that of customer details, such as address information and locations in which they have shopped at before. Basic information that is anonymous does not require great amounts of security however personal data such as names and mobile numbers must be prioritised in terms of security at all times in order to abide by the laws.

## Copyright act ##

#### Copyright gives the creators of some types of media rights to control how they're used and distributed. Music, books, video and software can all be covered by copyright law.

In this instance we need to make sure that content or software used in the project has to be that of free licenced material or permission granted content to avoid issues. This can include designs such as logos, and other content.

## Standards and contrains of QR code ##

There are various types of constraints that will restrain the idea itself, first being the initial concept of the idea for QR code requires the users using the software to have a mobile device or tablet that has a working internet connection for the scanning to work, as once the code is scanned and decrypted it searches the nessesary web address and diverts you accordingly. A possible solution to overcome users not having access to internet is being able to save QR codes to scan later when connection arises which can be stored in a possible history section with in the app itself.

Furthermore, majority of the time scanning a QR code is very efficient as long as a valid internet connection is available however due to various different devices which are used across the board details such as lighting and quality of the camera being used must be taken into consideration, in order to make this process more efficient and not put users off scanning the item. In such cases where the lighting isn't adequate an option within the app to turn any available camera flash light would be appropriate. In addition, considering the size of the QR code is another factor. If the size of the generated QR is that of 250x250 which is slightly larger than most commonly used codes it would allow ease of scanning and would be another solution for users with lower end devices this would not only benefit consumers but it would also mean that farmers or companies associated with transport means would find it much easier and would not require high end equipment. 

Also a beneficial use of using web analytics, and by using unique codes for different placements, marketers can gain some valuable information about how well campaigns are going, and what works and what doesn't. Once a QR code is scanned, using that information we can identify which products in what prime locations are popular. This could potentially be fed back to manufacturers and business if users are happy with sharing this information and as long as it abides by the regulations.
