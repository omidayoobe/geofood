## Computer Misuse Act 1990: ##

## The Computer misuse act consists of 3 main offences:
- -- Accessing computer material without permission, eg looking at someone else's files.
- -- Accessing computer material without permission with intent to commit further criminal offences.

#### Access clearance must be set for staff, so that people with unauthorized access are unable to retrieve data and alter information or make changes towards them with criminal intent or harm.

## The Data Protection act: ##


- -- The Data Protection Act (DPA) is a law designed to protect personal data stored on computers or in an organised paper filing system. The act itself follow 8 different principles which are:
Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless:


- -- Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.
Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.


#### Data related to the project may consist of personal information that of customer details, such as address information and locations in which they have shopped at before. Basic information that is anonymous does not require great amounts of security however personal data such as names and mobile numbers must be prioritised in terms of security at all times in order to abide by the laws.

## Copyright act ##

#### Copyright gives the creators of some types of media rights to control how they're used and distributed. Music, books, video and software can all be covered by copyright law.

In this instance we need to make sure that content or software used in the project has to be that of free licenced material or permission granted content to avoid issues. This can include designs such as logos, and other content.

## Standards and contrains of QR code ##

There are various types of constraints that will restrain the idea itself, first being the initial concept of the idea for QR code requires the users using the software to have a mobile device or tablet that has a working internet connection for the scanning to work, as once the code is scanned and decrypted it searches the nessesary web address and diverts you accordingly. A possible solution to overcome users not having access to internet is being able to save QR codes to scan later when connection arises which can be stored in a possible history section with in the app itself.

Furthermore, majority of the time scanning a QR code is very efficient as long as a valid internet connection is available however due to various different devices which are used across the board details such as lighting and quality of the camera being used must be taken into consideration, in order to make this process more efficient and not put users off scanning the item. In such cases where the lighting isn't adequate an option within the app to turn any available camera flash light would be appropriate. In addition, considering the size of the QR code is another factor. If the size of the generated QR is that of 250x250 which is slightly larger than most commonly used codes it would allow ease of scanning and would be another solution for users with lower end devices this would not only benefit consumers but it would also mean that farmers or companies associated with transport means would find it much easier and would not require high end equipment. 

Also a beneficial use of using web analytics, and by using unique codes for different placements, marketers can gain some valuable information about how well campaigns are going, and what works and what doesn't. Once a QR code is scanned, using that information we can identify which products in what prime locations are popular. This could potentially be fed back to manufacturers and business if users are happy with sharing this information and as long as it abides by the regulations. 

Besides the different acts of the misuse of a computer, we could find problem on the actual definition. Misuse per definition is to use something in the wrong way or for the wrong purposes.

## What is a QR Code:

QR codes are two-dimensional quick response codes that are now gaining notability and popularity in the United States. They are easy to use and versatile. The code itself stores huge amounts of information that is easily scanned and stored onto a mobile device. Many businesses are now adopting this code as a means of marketing and as another way to attract customers to the internet for more information. QR codes have both advantages and disadvantages and both benefits and drawbacks of the code should be understood before using the QR code as a marketing technique.

## Problems we could encounter with the use of QR codes are:

- --Losing the stamp
- --Various aliments or crates will be stored in either cold temperature rooms, fridges or hot rooms, therefor the condensation could       alter the QR code. Without saying unstick the sticker.
- --Moving the said merchandise, scratched or marks could be damaging the sticker
- --Distortion of an enlarged QR Code may be difficult or impossible to read it

- --If letters or pictures are placed around a QR Code, the required margin cannot be secured

- --If you place letters or pictures on an area overlapping a QR Code, the contrast between the bright and dark areas becomes               indistinct. This kind of code is difficult or impossible to read.

- --The other problem that many users have with QR is that it simply doesn&#39;t work very well. For a code to scan well it needs to be     done it good light, on a high contrast background

Also, we have to ask ourselves, what would happen to the merchandise if we lose/damage the QR code, do we throw away the merchandise, would that be politically/ethically correct? (needless to say, loss of profit)



## Other disadvantage of QR Codes:

One disadvantage of QR codes and perhaps the biggest problem is the lack of familiarity of the QR code among people. Although QR codes are popping up everywhere from on plant specimen labels to library catalogues, there is a large demographic in society that still don&#39;t know what QR codes represent. These proses a problem as companies and business are using the QR code to advertise information that a potential customer might be interested in, but if the customer doesn&#39;t know how to find the information, then they might not buy the product or service, this can lose business thousands of dollars. One way to counteract this disadvantage is product knowledge. Not only should businesses be using QR codes for it&#39;s obvious benefits and advantages, but they should also be directing customers on where and how to get the information. Another major disadvantage of a QR code is the codes dependability on a mobile device or smartphone. The whole concept of a QR code and its benefits are strictly based on its ability to be scanned by a mobile device. If a consumer does not have a mobile device or smartphone, then the QR code is not beneficial to them and they lose out.

## A good solution could be to 3D print the QR code

Smooth concrete works fine, uneven concrete is hard. Steel girders, smooth walls, painted walls, painted floors, tile, board, tables, plastic, paper all work well
