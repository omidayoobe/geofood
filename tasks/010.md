**Use Case Scenario**
===================
Instead of doing lots of cases that may change during production, I'm going to do one a very simple and small use case that follows the process. It will be very similar to the [plan.md](https://github.com/wtznc/software_projects/blob/master/Plan.md) file initially but this can be broken down and added to over time.

---

**Overview 1.0**

**Primary actors:**
Supplier
Shipping
Customer

**Preconditions:**
All have an active internet connection

**Basic flow of events:**
**1.** Supplier opens the non-consumer application and enters their details.

**2.** Supplier's details are validated.

**3.** Supplier selects the product they are about to hand to shipping.

**4.** Their details and details on the product are added to the database, timestamped, geotagged, and a QR code is generated and associated.

**5.** The supplier hands over the product to the carrier and using the same application, scans the QR code and associates their ID with the database entry.

**6.** Product arrives with the seller who scans the products location one final time.

**7.** Consumer opens the consumer specific application and has their details verified.

**8.** The QR code on the packaging of the product is scanned by the consumer.

**9.** The application displays information related to the product associated with that QR code held in the database.

**10.** This may include:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**10a.** Pictures of the supplier, how much the supplier was paid for the product, where the supplier is located, the list of carriers and locations the product has been, timestamped notable events for the product, CO2 footprint of product.

**11.** The consumer now has the information necessary to chose to purchase a product where they know who created it, where and when, who handled it, how long it took to get to them.

**Alternative flows:**

**2a.** Supplier is not validated

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2a1.** Non-consumer application displays an error message.

**5a.** If the product changes hands at any point, the process will be repeated for the new carrier.

**7a.** Consumer is not validated

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**7a1.** Consumer application displays an error message.

Also, this can live here for now until I know what to do with it and how it actually works...
