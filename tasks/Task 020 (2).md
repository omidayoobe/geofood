In  2015 GMA (Grocery Manufacturers Association) and the Food Marketing Institute formed to make a website called smart label. This website gives consumers information on things such as nutritional information, ingredients, allergens, third-party certifications, social compliance programs, usage instructions, advisories & safe handling instructions, company/brand information, along with other pertinent information about the product. Companies apply a Smart Label QR code on their products which then consumers can use any QR scanner app to get all the information they need or they can manually search the item on the Smart label website.More than 30 major companies which includes companies such as Nestle, Hershey, Reeses and Campbell,  have already committed to using SmartLabel™.

In late 2015, Hershey became the first brand to adopt SmartLabel, as of mid-July, Hershey had seen about 47,000 QR code scans from about 26,000 unique users on the 300 products currently labeled with the QR code in stores.

<b><u>customers perspective on QR codes</u></b>
<br>
The usage of QR codes in the food industry has mixed arguments as most consumers are for the technology but some against it.

advocates of the GMO (genetically modified organism) labelling has criticised the use of QR codes saying that grocery associations codes are discriminatory as this is a technology most consumers dont use, and a technology which might be prone to error as the codes might be unreadable due to wearing of from the product.

However According to the research most customers sees QR codes as it is a useful tool which helps consumers to get information on their products.Customers went on to say "Stickers can be displayed on food packaging, highlighting that the meat within is 100% British, but this doesn't guarantee that it has been ethically sourced or that the supply chain is sustainable. I am a truly cynical consumer; just because supermarkets put photos of their farmers on meat packages, doesn't reassure me"
