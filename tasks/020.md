Who are our main competitors and what app existing on the market?

Having search the web for competitors and already existing applications, the result was very interesting. Not only have I searched the English-speaking market, but French and Spanish as well.

French and Spanish market apps, are more focused on the quality of the food and the &quot;dietetic content&quot; they have. How to find the sanest aliment, what food has the best vitamins, which food to buy for specific diets, etc. Coming to traceability of their food, no app has been found.

Interesting enough, the English-speaking community understands, not knowing where their food comes from, is a real issue. Reading a review from the website [http://www.eatingwell.com/article/10290/trace-your-food/](http://www.eatingwell.com/article/10290/trace-your-food/), we can realise that people want to know.

Searching deeper in the web, several website had either the idea or had started to create this app. This very interesting review ( [http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2013/05/putting-food-traceability-at-consumers-fingertips/#.WfXPyddl82z](http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2013/05/putting-food-traceability-at-consumers-fingertips/#.WfXPyddl82z)), points to an Australian website, [http://kiallafoods.com.au/plate2farm/](http://kiallafoods.com.au/plate2farm/),

 that traces farm products, but so far nothing major in the performance/power of his app.

On a higher level, the food industry already uses traceability of the food they store and redistribute. Warehouses use this software, [https://www.emydex.com/software-modules/traceability-reporting/?gclid=CjwKCAjw-NXPBRB4EiwAVNRLKmtut1ZXCNTYqfGgNWzYfgGuks7bdhR0zotoTAizkKTw4z9B-1ofZRoCf3AQAvD\_BwE](https://www.emydex.com/software-modules/traceability-reporting/?gclid=CjwKCAjw-NXPBRB4EiwAVNRLKmtut1ZXCNTYqfGgNWzYfgGuks7bdhR0zotoTAizkKTw4z9B-1ofZRoCf3AQAvD_BwE), that not only traces the food but does reports about it. This website, [http://www.sourcemap.com](http://www.sourcemap.com) offers companies a Data-driven sustainability monitoring and evaluation by traceability, monitoring, verification and dashboards.

Existing application to track your food:

[https://www.provenance.org/](https://www.provenance.org/), uses blockchain technology to track your food, this is a quote from the BBC website (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/business-38773881/the-woman-using-technology-to-prove-where-food-comes-from)

_&quot;__The British company Provenance says it is lighting a fire under the retail world._

_The company has developed an app that allows retailers and customers to see where a product comes from - from origin to point of sale._

_&quot;Behind every product is a complex chain of people and places, and that&#39;s a really important part of why people buy things,&quot; founder Jessi Baker explains._

_&quot;Provenance is all about making that information transparent to shoppers, but also to businesses, all along the supply chain.&quot;_

[https://www.harvestmark.com/solutions.aspx](https://www.harvestmark.com/solutions.aspx), would be another serious competitor, as their app already exists on the market.

Believe or not even McDonalds, allows you to track the content of every aliment that you have in your burger [https://www.psfk.com/2013/01/mcdonalds-food-tracking-app.html](https://www.psfk.com/2013/01/mcdonalds-food-tracking-app.html).

In  2015 GMA (Grocery Manufacturers Association) and the Food Marketing Institute formed to make a website called smart label. This website gives consumers information on things such as nutritional information, ingredients, allergens, third-party certifications, social compliance programs, usage instructions, advisories & safe handling instructions, company/brand information, along with other pertinent information about the product. Companies apply a Smart Label QR code on their products which then consumers can use any QR scanner app to get all the information they need or they can manually search the item on the Smart label website.More than 30 major companies which includes companies such as Nestle, Hershey, Reeses and Campbell,  have already committed to using SmartLabel™.

In late 2015, Hershey became the first brand to adopt SmartLabel, as of mid-July, Hershey had seen about 47,000 QR code scans from about 26,000 unique users on the 300 products currently labeled with the QR code in stores.

<b><u>customers perspective on QR codes</u></b>
<br>
The usage of QR codes in the food industry has mixed arguments as most consumers are for the technology but some against it.

advocates of the GMO (genetically modified organism) labelling has criticised the use of QR codes saying that grocery associations codes are discriminatory as this is a technology most consumers dont use, and a technology which might be prone to error as the codes might be unreadable due to wearing of from the product.

However According to the research most customers sees QR codes as it is a useful tool which helps consumers to get information on their products.Customers went on to say "Stickers can be displayed on food packaging, highlighting that the meat within is 100% British, but this doesn't guarantee that it has been ethically sourced or that the supply chain is sustainable. I am a truly cynical consumer; just because supermarkets put photos of their farmers on meat packages, doesn't reassure me"
