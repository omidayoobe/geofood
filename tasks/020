Who are our main competitors and what app existing on the market?

Having search the web for competitors and already existing applications, the result was very interesting. Not only have I searched the English-speaking market, but French and Spanish as well.

French and Spanish market apps, are more focused on the quality of the food and the &quot;dietetic content&quot; they have. How to find the sanest aliment, what food has the best vitamins, which food to buy for specific diets, etc. Coming to traceability of their food, no app has been found.

Interesting enough, the English-speaking community understands, not knowing where their food comes from, is a real issue. Reading a review from the website [http://www.eatingwell.com/article/10290/trace-your-food/](http://www.eatingwell.com/article/10290/trace-your-food/), we can realise that people want to know.

Searching deeper in the web, several website had either the idea or had started to create this app. This very interesting review ( [http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2013/05/putting-food-traceability-at-consumers-fingertips/#.WfXPyddl82z](http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2013/05/putting-food-traceability-at-consumers-fingertips/#.WfXPyddl82z)), points to an Australian website, [http://kiallafoods.com.au/plate2farm/](http://kiallafoods.com.au/plate2farm/),

 that traces farm products, but so far nothing major in the performance/power of his app.

On a higher level, the food industry already uses traceability of the food they store and redistribute. Warehouses use this software, [https://www.emydex.com/software-modules/traceability-reporting/?gclid=CjwKCAjw-NXPBRB4EiwAVNRLKmtut1ZXCNTYqfGgNWzYfgGuks7bdhR0zotoTAizkKTw4z9B-1ofZRoCf3AQAvD\_BwE](https://www.emydex.com/software-modules/traceability-reporting/?gclid=CjwKCAjw-NXPBRB4EiwAVNRLKmtut1ZXCNTYqfGgNWzYfgGuks7bdhR0zotoTAizkKTw4z9B-1ofZRoCf3AQAvD_BwE), that not only traces the food but does reports about it. This website, [http://www.sourcemap.com](http://www.sourcemap.com) offers companies a Data-driven sustainability monitoring and evaluation by traceability, monitoring, verification and dashboards.

Existing application to track your food:

[https://www.provenance.org/](https://www.provenance.org/), uses blockchain technology to track your food, this is a quote from the BBC website (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/business-38773881/the-woman-using-technology-to-prove-where-food-comes-from)

_&quot;__The British company Provenance says it is lighting a fire under the retail world._

_The company has developed an app that allows retailers and customers to see where a product comes from - from origin to point of sale._

_&quot;Behind every product is a complex chain of people and places, and that&#39;s a really important part of why people buy things,&quot; founder Jessi Baker explains._

_&quot;Provenance is all about making that information transparent to shoppers, but also to businesses, all along the supply chain.&quot;_

[https://www.harvestmark.com/solutions.aspx](https://www.harvestmark.com/solutions.aspx), would be another serious competitor, as their app already exists on the market.

Believe or not even McDonalds, allows you to track the content of every aliment that you have in your burger [https://www.psfk.com/2013/01/mcdonalds-food-tracking-app.html](https://www.psfk.com/2013/01/mcdonalds-food-tracking-app.html).
